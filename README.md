# Project-on-World-Bank-Analysis
Comparisons between different measures of development in countries.
In this project I've worked on "World Bank Analysis" to find out the disparities between different countries of the world, where using R I performed the whole analysis displaying the difference between growth factors, GDP, and many more measures of country development to figure which country is the least developed and some major factors. I took the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository of World Bank Data.
